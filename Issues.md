its an app which is sending you an daily code review on what you have been working on



Key Components and Workflow

GitHub Integration:
Use GitHub Webhooks to trigger events when code is pushed to your repository.
Webhooks can notify your server or service whenever a push event occurs.
Fetching Code Changes:
Once triggered, the server fetches the specific changes made in the push event.
Use GitHub API to get the latest commits and the diff (changes) for each pushed file.
Â 
Code Analysis with a Large Language Model (LLM):
Feed the fetched code changes into an LLM for review.
Use advanced models like GPT-4 or Claude-3.5 Sonnet for the initial implementation.
Define prompts that guide the LLM on what specific aspects to consider (e.g., best practices, potential bugs, optimization).
Generating Feedback:
The LLM generates feedback based on your code. This might include code quality, styling issues, potential bugs, and optimization suggestions.
Format the feedback in a structured manner for clarity and ease of understanding.
Email Automation:
Use an email service (like SendGrid, Mailgun, or even a simple SMTP setup) to send the feedback to your email address.
Ensure the email is well-formatted, with clear sections for different types of feedback.

this is only going to work out if i have app which can read all of the code from the user. if i for now just want to do this for me then this would be better because then i can validate it first and i have much more development speed. i can make it open source first so that others can set it up already if they want so.

- Reduced by 2 hours

Code Review Metrics:
- Time to Review: 15 minutes
- Number of Review Comments: 10

Dependency Updates:
- Updated library ABC from version 1.0 to 1.1

### Detailed Feedback:
General Code Quality:
- The new functions in module X are well-structured.
- Consider refactoring method Y to improve readability.

Potential Bugs:
- In function ABC, there seems to be an unhandled edge case when the input is negative.

Optimization Suggestions:
- The loop in function XYZ can be optimized by using a dictionary for faster lookups.

Best Practices / Style Issues:
- Ensure you follow PEP 8 standards for variable naming.
- Avoid using global variables in module ABC.

Security Concerns:
- Potential SQL injection risk in method DEF. Consider using parameterized queries.

Code Snippets:
In method XYZ, consider the following refactor:

```python
# Current code
for i in range(len(arr)):
    if arr[i] == target:
        return i

# Suggested refactor
index_lookup = {value: idx for idx, value in enumerate(arr)}
return index_lookup.get(target, -1)
